# Big Matrix
Code for controlling 64x8 LED matrix. Contains demos for displaying scrolling markov chain generated text.

!["Hey World!"](https://raw.github.com/AlexLamson/bigmatrix/master/photo.jpg "Hey World!")
*(The display isn't large enough to show "Hello World!" all at once, so I opted for a shorter greeting)*
